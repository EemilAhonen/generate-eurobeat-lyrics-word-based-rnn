2 Fast,Burning Up The Night (Total Fire),"One more a burning night
One more a death inside
One more a dream to live
My... own

Baby baby see me cry
Never forget I'm a man now
Baby baby now it's time
For the fight! fight! fight!

Burning up the night
The street's on fire
Burning deep inside
My love's forever

Burning up the night
My hot desire
Burning up my life
Total fire

Burning up the night
My heart's on fire
Burning deep inside
'Till the end of my life

Burning up the night
I'll take you higher
Burning up my life
Take my hand be ready... go!

One more a life to give
One more a love to live
One more a pain inside
My... heart","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=3411

70's Queens Feat. Annalise & Virginelle,Get Up And Move It,"Trying to fight against a day never ending
Watching the time but it's always the same
It never changes, time is endless take me
To fantasy land now

Where there is music and the beat's getting stronger
Day is all gone and the night is much longer
I can dream that you're with me and here
You're here to stay

'Cause there's nothing anyone can say
This is my dream and I can wish away anything
I don't want in my mind
And I'm free now

Get up and move it (you know that you can do it)
Get up and move it
And let the rhythm take you away to fantasy land
You know that ti can so

Get up and move it (you know that you can do it)
Get up and move it
And let the rhythm take you away to fantasy land
You know that it can

Look at me now - well there's a smile on my face and
You show me how to get to that magic place and
I feel young, I'm goin' strong I'm ready
For fantasy land now

Give me the beat and I can get through the day now
Show me the lights and then show me the way now
Dance the night 'till morning light you're with me
You're here to stay","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2879

7th Heaven,It's My Life,"Don't run to me just when you need me
To save you all the time
Don't call me up just when you want me
To fill up the void in your heart

But this time
It's gonna be the only one
It's gonna be the last and the best of your live
I wanna be the number one
I wanna be the number one king of your heart

Tell me tell me, why you don't want me
It's my life you're gonna give away

7th Heaven,Last Christmas,"[Chorus (2x):]
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby,
Do you recognize me?
Well,
It's been a year,
It doesn't surprise me

(Happy Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,""
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]

Oh baby, oh

A crowded room,
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart, ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus 2x]

I gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone special

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore him apart","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4385

Back magic just to take time

Bad power I can feel it now
Back magic just to take my time

You were stealing the life

I just to the stars
Come to me
Only an illusion can start
My heart can be
Take my time, dance with me
I can take out my heart

In the sky there's a blackhall
That I can not see
In my heart there's a deep hole

Baby don't break my heart
Let me trun it up

When you try to make me look the fool

See you passing, by, you're just the boy I'm thinking of

And we'll have a good time flying high

And be your angel, your angel

Billy Mette,Beyond My Heart (Hyper Genesis Remix),"Looking beyond my heart
I know I cannot stay with you, there is nothing I can do
Thinking we'd never break apart
Before reality showed its face, and for you I have no place

Year after year, we were the closest of friends
Tear after tear, we would always make mends
Looking back now, you know we both had it all
It's too little too late, now we have to take the fall

I can't stay here, sorry but it's over
You know our lives aren't forever
Though our friendship took us very far
You have to recognize just who are.

You made me much stronger than before
But things are not the same anymore
There's still so much more for you to see
It's time you know how life is meant to be

Looking beyond my heart
This dream is breaking you and me, we have nowhere left to be
We were doomed from the very start
Although we hoped we'd overcome, this fight never could be won

Fear after fear, we'd put our worries to rest
We were so certain of what we thought was best
All in the moment, nothing stood in our way
But it's time to begin once again right here today

Look in the mirror, you'll see a different face
Blinded nostalgia is a dangerous waste
I'm devastated leaving you all alone
But without me your choices are finally your own.","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4392

Hoping the things now could change

In a moment everything can change now
Feel the wind is blowing on our shoulder
You can let go of yesterday
And spread out your wings now

Forget the troubles we can shine
Fly high the sky
And we can fly-y-y
'Cos now the time and we can try
Forget today and focus only tomorrow

Fly-y-y
Forget the reasons of our life
Fly high tonight
And we can fly-y-y
Just feel alive and don't you cry
Forget the blues and find a dream we can follow

We're flying higher above the blue

Awake overnight they are living above

These men's dreaming is all about her
These men's passion is right

Riding fast than light","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4214

only our silly conversations again
but I miss those happy days
and they seem so far away
can we still be good friends
can we be true to ourselves

and I can't recall when we became two friends
I got those memories so deep in my heart
and I look into your eyes
cause I feel you've changed your mind
and we need our love again (?) lose a friend

some day I'm gonna have the best of my life
tell me why we don't feel the way we used to feel
we were so young when days were funny and free
and the memory of you goes back to me
best of my friend

please be the one I can finally talk to
don't tell me that you think I'm so beautiful
let me think you're kidding me
and I talk so seriously
cause the dollars or money really don't mean a thing

don't slide those moments between me and you
I knew that what was wrong and you knew it too
don't betray yourself for me
be the friend you used to be
either that or (?) tender feeling back to me

some day I'm gonna have the best of my life
tell me why we can't go the way we used to be
we were so young when days were funny and free
and the feeling of you goes back to me
best of my friend

something irreplaceable
something that you can't exchange with anything
I'd like to go back
what we once used to be
when we were just friends
walking hand in hand
with no doubt or sense

some day I'm gonna have the best of my life
tell me why we don't feel the way we used to feel
we were so young when days were funny and free
and the memory of you my friend goes back to me

Take a chance
Let yourself go to this new romance
'Till tomorrow
Let me guess what you are looking for

I kiss your face
I kiss your blue eyes I know
That I keep on fall in love

We're making out
We make everything that you want
Just to keep on making love

I wanna see
I want everything you give
Just to keep on falling love

You are the king
You got what is called the good thing
And I keep on wanting love

You're so bad, believe when I told ya
You're so bad, you're bad to the bone
You're hard to the core
I'm wanting for more

Moscow, Tokyo, united by energy
Land of ice and cold, now the day of change has come
Dancing to the beat, the beat of the rising sun

Now you see the people on the Red Square
Jumping and grooving
Singing wild and movin'

Get down on the streets and go everywhere
A new sound's coming
A new fun's growing

Feel the fever, Gorky Park is burning
Feel the heat in Gorky Park
Feel the fever, Gorky Park is fooling
Feel the heat in Gorky Park

Falling like the snow, up and down the land of Don
Use your heart and soul, so listen boys and girls
Free your fantasy, with this good hiigh-energy
Move your hands and feet... you dance for rising sun","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=1259

In the midnight hours, I have killed all my hopes

Clara Moroni,Movin' On,"A walk in the park, still I'm thinking of you
You sat your spell on me
Burden I cannot bear
We should have lived together

I can't pretend, still I'm waiting for you
There's so much going on
I wish I could go on
We should have stayed together

But I keep movin' on
But I keep movin' on
But I keep movin' on
I've been waiting too long

But I keep movin' on
But I keep movin' on
But I keep movin' on
I've been waiting so long

Sweet pain and pleasure
Imagining us together

Where did we go? We use to be
young in the heart
Life is often not fair, hurts us inside big time
and the memories of us fade away

'Cause I keep movin' on
'Cause I keep movin' on
'Cause I keep movin' on
I've been waiting too long

'Cause I keep movin' on
'Cause I keep movin' on
'Cause I keep movin' on

Sweet pain and pleasure
Imagining us together
Sweet pain and pleasure
Imagining us together

Clara Moroni - The Digital Wheel

How can I live with all this pain
The secret question's just the same
I'm trapped in these walls so humid and grey
and part of my life is going insane
I don't want to be apart of this game

Give me your hand, give me your mouth
I don't want to be part of the doubt
I'll do what I want, I'll do what I feel
I don't wanna be apart of the wheel
The digital wheel

How can I live with all this shame
My old question's just the same
They can hang me on the wall
To be viewed by all
There's a lesson that I've learned
I don't want to be apart of the whole

Give me your hand, give me your mouth
I don't want to be part of the doubt
I'll do what I want, I'll do what I feel

Clara Moroni,Ten Worlds,"One
Sometimes I'm in Hell
Stuck to the ground
And do way to get up
Two
And I've fed my own greed
Children's tears
Coming out of anger
Three
I am an animal
Longing for what I think I need
Four
Sat on the throne of rage
Railing at a world that's so unfair

Ten worlds I'm living in
Cross my life
TEn worlds I can't give in
Worlds of freedom
But I just can't stand
Just can stand so much

Ten worlds I'm living in
Day by day
This very moment
I'll get the right attitude
But I just can't stand
Just can't stand so much

Five
Sometimes I'm in peace
I'm alive, simply I feel human
Six
A shattering ecstasy
Fills my heart
Water cleanses my face
Seven I want to know everthing
Get in touch with the core of my life
Eight And I can see the light
Conscious thought I've not reached it yet

Ten worlds I'm living in
Through my days
Ten worlds I keep within
State of living
But I just can't take
Just can't take too much

Ten worlds I'm living in
I look inside
And can't see my things
I'll find my way to the truth
'Cause I just scan't stand
Just can't stand so much

Nine
Everyone is here for me to feel
Ten
I understand

Ten worlds I'm living in
Cross my life
Ten worlds I can't give in
Worlds of freedom
But I just can't take
Just can't take too much

Ten worlds I'm living in

Got a long way to go alone

Because I'm loosing my mind watching you
I'm gonna fall in love

See you again and I get lost forever now
I'm looking for the present for you
Don't wanna lose you and I feel that I'm going to be
Your victim of love

Lookin' for the energy to feel I'm alright

Tell me how you're feelin'
Everybody's reelin' when you turn off the light

Everybody dance in the dark

Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world (a whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No-one to tell us ""no!"" or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world (everytime a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (every moment red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Anywhere there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world (a whole new world)
That's where we'll be (that's where we'll be)
The thrilling chase (a wondrous place)

Dave & Domino,Can You Feel The Love Tonight,"I can see what's happ'ning
They don't have a clue
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two

The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace, the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? (Impossible!)
She'd turn away from me

He's holding back, he's hiding
But why I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace, the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=916

Dave Rodgers,Nothing Changed,"You and I, thinking of all the times we spent together. 
Everyday seemed to me, 
I like a walking dream, a picture of perfection 
But gradually, as time goes by, seems your love lost its lustre. 
With your eyes full of doubt, your suspicions aroused, your voices so full of tension. 
Recently you're been pouting, accusing me of unkindness. 
Tell me, how could you believe 
I would ever hurt you so please listen to what I say 

I will protect you, don't you forget it, your love means the world to me girl. 
You are my angel, nothing will change that, your love is what keeps me strong girl. 
Love is forever, time is a healer, let's welcome the joy to come, girl. 
Deeper &amp; deeper, sweeter &amp; sweeter, together we'll build a future that lasts. 

Losing sight of the precious things that made us special. 
Pretty quarrels all day, see our temper are frayed, rejection &amp; depression. 
Clever words and conversation won't save us from this heartache. 
There's a far better way of expressing ourselves, I'll hold you oh so tightly. 
We're both been playing games, let's give this fighting a rest now. 
Turn our backs on the past, we'll forget all the pain, the good times are here to stay. ","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=1545

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile

Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky &amp; Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this

Talk about a lucky queen
Dancing in the eastern dream
Yeah! she makes me feel like a river owl
That carries me away...

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see

She's so good to me

But I'm at home and I, I just don't belong...

So far away from the garden you love
She is what moves in the solar, the dove
Soon I shall see just how blank was my mind
When we're alone in the city of mind

Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah! she turns me on like a fire owl
I get high !!!

Before you let me feel what it's for

And no I've lost all my defences but I just don't care
No need to put up false pretences, you're still all I crave
Don't leave me knocking on my door, don't you leave me sore
Because it's time for me to drag you on","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2598

Delta Queens,Music Has The Power,"Today is a better day instead of
bloody war we've got groovy music around
Hello! To music generation
Nothing to forget

Back in the days when took place sad and silent youth and
with no tag
Back in the days when took place a feeling called...
loneliness
It's better now that

Music has the power
And the music leads us like a guiding light
People eat sonic flowers
The republic sings and rhythm is the low

Let's play, what you've got to say instead of
creepy nights you got sunlight's ray in the sky
Hello! To music generation
Nothing to forget","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2594

Gonna be wilder than ever seen before.
There's no truth. There's no meaning of the creed.
Bloodly rotten to the core.
Arrogant Breaker stay hungry for speed.
Heading for the shooting star of Arion.
Ringing the bell now's the time to bleed.
Warning light for Rebellion.

Regret of past mistakes cuts me like a sharp poison knife.
It's getting out of hand. I've got to prove the way of life.
Ruined Empire, pour fuel on the fire.
Ten mighty lancers ready to rush.
Who will draw the curtain?

Here comes the Breaker growling furiously.
Causing tragic harm never seen before.
Could be dangerous no more glorious.
We'll be crawling on all fours.
Until the day of evolution.
Looking back at the age of evolution.

Standing tall against the pain.

For killing down my street

Keeping your eyes to find 
Your old avengence
I know that Kobra is my killer
You'll hear the snake

The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grins?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, of a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all colors of the wind","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=852

And your face is everywhere
Reaching out to you
Find that you are just not there
And it's like an endless fight
I will never win

Where are you now - what have you found
Who's with you when I'm not around
Every night I wake up and the state I'm in
Make me feel so sad and blue

Baby take a chance on my broken heart
Make me feel you care about me 'cos we're together
Baby take a chance on my broken heart
Don't turn me around and around again forever

Baby I can hear your voice
And it seems so close to me
Yet so far away
I feel like I should cry
And I try to let it out
But my eyes are dry","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=740

Nothing else can destroy my life because

Make your deepest wishes come true

Say a little prayer for this love of mine
Tonite I feel so cold and lonely
I long for your touch
Say a little prayer for this broken heart
Say a little prayer for this soul of mine
Tonite I feel so cold and lonely
I long for your loving

Tell me why
Picking up the pieces of my broken heart. Can’t survive.","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4058

What we have done to this holy planet, I don't understand

Leaving planet Earth, reaching for the moon
Come now, lift my rocket higher
Leaving planet Earth, I'll be landin' soon
I will fly into the fire!
Leaving planet Earth, going past the moon
Come now, lift my rocket higher
Leaving planet Earth, gonna sing this tune
Now that, I have left it all behind

Planet Earth, one must reason for whom
We're realizing your task is dangerous
Planet Earth, be it while I am trusting you
Please remember you're the only one","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4461

Euroteam Feat. Annerley Gordon,Can't Stop The Music,"On the radio, on every TV show 
for each and every reason, each and every season
Music when we love for the moon above 
music for the show of life that never ends
Music on a plane, music on a train
sailing on the ocean, music in the motion
Music in your car, at your local bar
There's music when you look at a star

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Keep your love apart, mend a broken heart
Catch a falling star that's much easier
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Till the sun don't shine, got about the time
'Cause that's easier to do

Movin' with the wind since the world began
the beat is gonna getcha, beat is gonna getcha
Music for the blues, for your dancin' shoes
there's music in the way that we kiss, you can't resist
Movin' through the trees, buzzin' with the bees
the sound is gettin' louder, sound is gettin' louder
Music when we play, when we kneel to pray
There's music in the sound of the wind

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Take the heat from flame, try not feeling pain
though you try in vain it's much easier
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Change the master plan, take the hope from man 
'Cause that's easier to do

Everyone you meet, the children in the street
There's no place to hide, so, why even try?

Everyone you meet, the children in the street 
are swayin' to the rhythm, there's somethin' movin' in them
There's no place to hide, so, why even try? 
Can't you hear it coming your way, it's here to stay
Music in our walk, music when we talk
It's really something magic, to lose it would be tragic
Can't you feel the sound movin' through the ground? 
Music makes the world go around

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Take the cold from snow, tell the trees, don't grow
tell the wind, don't blow, 'cause it's easier
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Take the spark from love, make the rain fall up

Fred Ventura,Wind Of Change,"Long days without a face
With nothing more to say
Closed in your silent room
Waiting for better days.

When the night is coming
There's nothing more to do
She comes walking in silence
Always dressing in blue.

Your heartbeat seems to fade
Don't runaway anymore
Your anger burns inside
That's not the life you ask for.

This is the wind of change
There's nowhere to go
No time, no place to hide
Anywhere in the world.

You can get, you can get what you want
Life is so strange and so full of desires
Day by day, try to follow your way
The wind of change is burning out the fire.

Don't waste your time again
Too many years have gone
You are lying in the dark
Open yourself to the sun.

This is the wind of change
There's nowhere to go
No time, no place to hide
Anywhere in the world.

You can get, you can get what you want
Life is so strange and so full of desires
Day by day, try to follow your way
The wind of change is burning out the fire.

This is the wind of change
Please don't go
No time, no place to hide in the world","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2080

Tell me why, every time
You get up and right into my
Precious life

Stuff like that
Can you believe in me
Look at my pretty heaven
Stuff like that
A celebration
One night, try me

Stuff like that
It's not that easy man
Finding a such a cool girl
Stuff like that
Don't wonder more man
Hot night, taste me

When you touch my heart
And my emotions?
Happiness not a shadow
You can trust me now

Go Go Girls,Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,"Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

It's...
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

Because I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lad
My father gave me nose a tweak
And told me I was bad
But then one day I learned a word
That saved me achin' nose

The biggest word I ever heard
And this is how it goes: Oh!

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

He traveled all around the world
And everywhere he went
He'd use his word and all would say
""There goes a clever gent""

When Dukes and maharajas 
Pass the time of day with me
I say me special word and then
They ask me out to tea

Oh..
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word
And then you've got a lot to say
But better use it carefully
Or it could change your life

One night I said it to me girl
And now me girl's my wife!","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2072

Wanna see whatever it may bring
Baby close your eyes, let's fly together
Give a chance to love, just let it go
Wanna feel you now, let's fly together

Jager,Because Of You,"No matter how I try
To give you all my life
'Cause everything I did
I wore my heart on my sleeve
One body's not enough

If there's no soul within
I think we got it rough
Livin' out the mess I'm in

No, no, don't you shout!
I don't wanna keep you out
Come on, don't you scream!
I still wanna live the dream
Oh no, don't let go!
Did I ever say no more?
Don't wanna blow you away

It's because of you
I thought that I knew
And now what is left to me?
The more I give the more you take
To feel complete
Just to feel complete

Because of you
I've never been true
I never really knew
I was just the man to please your ecstasy
For your ecstasy
Just because of you

You're always in my mind
and I was feeling blind
Now can you face the fact
That I'm not turning back?
I gave up everything
And it was just for you
Money, glory, fame
My soul and god even more

No, no, don't you shout!
I don't wanna keep you out
Come on, don't you scream!
I still wanna live the dream
Oh oh, don't let go!
Did I ever say no more?
Don't wanna blow you away

Because of you
I've never been true
I never really knew
I was just the man to please your ecstasy
For your ecstasy
Because of you
Just because of you

So you hide all alone, how do you feel girl?
Turn around, take my hand, look at me now
Just because of you, because of you,
because of you, because of you","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=3852

So I said can't you wait a bit longer
I'll give you all that a lover should give

Jennifer,He Is The Reason,"He could just kill me with a word
he could just save with a smile
he knows he rules my world just like a tyrant

Some might think that I'm a coward
Some might think that I'm infantile
I know, only to me, he's so important
Yes, I'm in love

I can't find any words to say what I'm feeling
Oh, I need nothing else but love

He is the reason why I'm so happy
He's the reason why I'm so sad
I always wonder why I'm so crazy like this all the time
He is the reason why I'm so happy
He's the reason why I'm so sad
I always wonder why I'm so crazy, I wonder why

He could take everything from me
He could give everything to me
I cannot lose him and I can't forget him

Sometimes I wish I could be free
Sometimes I wish I could forsee
the future that I could live in without him
But I'm in love","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4561

staring at your blue eyes.
But you are keeping me out of your sight.
Are you afraid of ties?
We broke up already you would say.
I don't think it's been true between us.
It's you that turns away from what we try to share.

I'm gonna hold you, and kiss you, and make you
feel like you're the only one I need.
And you can hold me, and kiss me, and make me
feel like I'm the only one you need.
What are you tryin' to do to me?
Let's get in motion.

There's something I have to say, my baby.
You must have got me wrong.
Don't you remember we helped each other?
There's no need to be strong.
We haven't talked enough, I would say.
If you don't want to listen to me
You know that we'll be losing what we try to share.

You promised me that you would always always be around

Searching for a destiny that's mine in this confusior
Only in my dreams I've got this heart and soul
Hopping that I'll never have to find it's an illusion

Can hurt somehow

HEART AND SOUL capture the sun
HEART AND SOUL to loosen the wire
Forget my sorrow and let all fade away

Every time I'm hearing of a HEART AND SOUL
I would ride the air if I could fly the right direction

The web in my hand
Can try to building tower

Mask and hood are saving my features
Don't be scurvy, I'm waiting

Everybody's looking the battle

John Desire,Come On Feel The Ecstasy,"So shy you seem, careful to care not at all.
Spin around, spin around
Clinging to your heart so it won't fall.
But what is the truth under the mask that you wear?
Let it go, let it go
Throw away the foolish pride inside.

Follow the magic in the music,
All of your wildest dreams come true.
Don't be afraid of your emotions,
Think of what's waiting for you.

A brand new world opens up its loving arms to you.

Wake up, desire! (I need you, don't you know?)
Light up your fire! (I love you, don't you know?)
Go cast your spell and make her love me,
Please, please, please!
Wake up, desire! (I want you, no, no, no!)
Light up her fire! (I love you, no, no, no!)
Old devil rhythm, turn her heart to me.

You turn away, claiming you want to be free
Spin around, spin around
Warm and safe inside your loneliness.
But don't be afraid of heartbreaks that may never be.
Let it go, let it go
Take away the mask and look my way.

Open your mind and feel the music,
Ride on the tide of the swelling tune.
Fighting your heart is like a wave
Fighting the pull of the moon.

Look in my eyes, can't you see I want you here in my arms?

Wake up, desire! (You want me, don't you know?)
Light up your fire! (You need me, don't you know?)
Go cast your spell and make her love me,
Don't leave me hanging on forever,
Stop, stop! (Baby, come on! Don't stop the music!)
Wake up, desire! (I want you, no, no, no!)
Light up her fire! (I love you, no, no, no!)
Old devil rhythm, bring her love to me.

Come feel the ecstasy,
Come dance away with me,
Hold me tight, hold me tight!

Wake up, desire! (I want you, no, no, no!)
Light up her fire! (I love you, no, no, no!)
Old devil rhythm, bring her home to me.","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2351

Tears never stopped, it looked like the end of the world
Look at the sky, sail the sea, to the world, of your love

Uncheatable her shapely line
A convict of her lithe crime
Save me and wrap around one more time
Make a change and turn around under a wave
Back on ground holding scolding the darker side

The summer is burning a hole in my heart
Stripping me down to hot temptation
It's OK to give in be beaten by lust, summer wind,
Burning air a scandal affair

Mysterious mermaid barefoot all alone
Wishing revealing it's the fruit I want to eat
Precious love is always eating up my heart

Fairies, summer folk will stimulate my fantasies
Mysterious mermaid barefoot all alone
Wishing revealing it's the fruit I want to eat
Precious love is always eating up my heart

Fagged out that's you and me, gave you the better side of me
This town is gloomy nothing to be found
Don't wanna stop or cool down, go forever not hang around
Don't wanna hear a boring joke in my open mind

The sky is burning a firework delight
Painting colour through the night
Holding me tightly I grab the light, summer wind,
Burning fire, getting me high

Judy Crystal,God Of Romance,"What good's sitting at home
All alone on the shelf?
If you want to find romance, you've got to find it yourself
The someone I'm waiting for
Is somewhere waiting for me
So somewhere is the place I've really got to be

Lots of fish in the sea
But you need the right bait
To hook a tall, and tan, and, young and handsome
Saturday mate
I'll go pick out a dress
Something sexy, but smart
Gotta catch his eye to capture his heart

Gotta make it easier to notice me there
You may not get a second try
Mr. Right may be passing you by
Don't you sit there, get him
While the getting is good

Boy meets girl
It happens all the time
Suddenly it hits you, with no reason or rhyme
Fall in love
Do you believe in miracles?
Listen to the god of romance!

Take the sexy young me
Into a trendy new club
Where the young and rich and famous bring their elders to rub 
But in an elegant throng I feel my confidence sink 
I think I need a very alcoholic drink

So then I put down a gin
And ask for more of the same
I hear a gentle voice say ""Thank you Madame, what is your name?"" 
I pick my head off the bar And see him smiling at me 
And all at once I feel I own the earth and sea

Do you see the way that he looks into my eyes?
My heart is beating wild
Says ""Here's your change"" and touches my hand
And I'm reeling
Reeling
Feelings I've never known

Boy meets girl
Can happen anywhere
And before you know it you are walking on air
Fall in love
It's happy even after
Listen to the god of romance

I wander out and check my horoscope today
It says my lucky stars are out tonight
And that a person's gonna come into my life
And love me and be with me now tomorrow
And then forever more

Burning deeper into my veins

Karen,Real Love,"Love....Now I know feelings of love
Now I know how much was wrong
And I don't wanna be alone
With someone without feeling

Love....Without love I could be lost
And I'm sure I have to learn
That the false stories are wrong
I will try to get real love

This is love  I could never think was so
This is love  With no body I've felt in love
This is love  Nothing else can matter now
The nicest story I'm living

This love has more shine than the sun
It's so much stronger than a storm
And you can't never get it never
Can't you know I'm feeling

So....Now I'm glad the past is gone
When I thought I was more strong
Standing with lot of girls
Who gave me only things you know","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2438

Laying on my boat as I sail away...
Waiting for the captain to bring me

No need to worry, just sail away...

Pulling me like a magnet...
Try to imagine it...power is what you get
With no feeling of regret...","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2607

Or have a swimming pool near his backyard
But I love him so I want the world to know

Like by far what you can on getting
But never make me feel this way
Cause there's no something to choose for his love
There's nothing anyone can pay

For all the money you have to spend

Burning up my love

Can't hide
Can't go

Go away, Go away
Why won't you go away
Letting go is the only answer now
You can't go back, you can't say that
Now go away
Doing that, fighting back, you're sailing away
Hating it, you're saying it, it's burning away.
Going back, fixing that, needless to say

The mystery of midnight and spell

Will make the escape

I won' t get anywhere
Without love, I wouldn' t care
So why don' t you come my way
And take me to heaven

People say that love is a taxi driver
Jump inside, easy come and go
Never ask the way, you come my way
But tonight why don't you open

Taxi taxi taxi driver
Open up your car and go (Gooooooo)
On a joyride to desire
Drive on a journey to heaven

Taxi taxi taxi driver
Open up your car and go
Riding through the streets of fire
Drive on a journey to heaven with me

Oh babe
Drive me back home to you
And don' t ask me if I do
Believe all the things I say
To catch your attention

Why don' t you take the wheel Of my love
and make me feel
We' re driving to somewhere new","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=1766

Shadow of the beloved one faraway

Like crimson foliage
Forbidden love is the sweetest fruit, would you like a bite?

Falling, falling, falling
Colorful days gone by
Vanished into the clouds

In the dark, mountains burning in a blaze
The floating bridge of dreams, a ruined palace of the glory
Beneath the autumn leaves, a gust of wind in the night
Withered pampas grass, blind in the secret date

Ah, she was the Lady Blue
Shadow of the beloved one faraway
Love affairs... there's no turning back
My life was like the cicada shell

I'm falling, falling, falling
Like crimson foliage
Forbidden love is the sweetest fruit, would you like to choose?

Punished into the haze

Give me the night
Shake your head

Unintentional love

Take a new sensation
Move in right direction

To feel my mind, hold me back
We are the friends in the name of love
I need an ever lasting love
To feel my mind, hold me back

A place where we can be alone

Above the sky we'll fly so high

Don't let the clouds get in the way

We'll dance with all of the stars
As we go higher
You and I
We'll reach the top
Together we will zoom away
To heaven

And when you need to go
And find a place you can stay
Where you can ne who you are
You just call me
I'll be around for you

It's not impossible
Yes we can disappear from here
Oh it's my dream to have you near
Let me sweep your feet off the ground

Please let me take you way above the sky
Far away
You will be there someday
If you let me I'll take you now

That we should fly up so high

Let's go and touch the moon today","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=1612

Without a love no one can life
I need you darling stand by me
I don't resist you can't you see, baby

Why don't you love me baby
Why don't you trust me honey
Why don't you break my heart tonight
Fallen angel

Why don't you love me baby
Why don't you trust me honey
Why don't you make me feel the heat
Make me feel the heat

Why, my people run the human race
I met a friend who lost his face
The world is looking for a peace
Got to find the reason why","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=1819

Lives within my heart

I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy
So was I
When she loved me

Through the summer
And the fall
We had each other
That was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be

And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew
That she loved me

So the years went by
I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone

Still I waited for the day
When she'd say I will always
Love you

Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
And she smiled at me and held me
Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me

When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful

On the line ""The sweet fullfillment of their secret longing"", the printed lyrics and original lyrics are ""As sweet fullfillment of their secret drowns""

Lyrics ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dreams
No request is to extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fullfillment of their secret longing
Like a boat out of the blue
Fate steps in and see's you through","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2079

Take the path that moonbeams make

Up you go with a heigh and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Neverland waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dreams that you dream will come true

Tonight will be the magic moment to ride
The fear I've deep inside is growing
Alive and kicking out
The beat of my heart

Up in the sky
A light is shining over me and I cry
They're catchin' me but I'm not ready to fly away
I wouldn't leave, oh my god

Runaway
For your life
Don't you feel you're in danger
Gotta hide away
They're reachin' your soul

You gotta fight 'em
Cos' you'll be the one
Star to star with the black U.F.O.
Gotta move on
This time's goin' on
Help me baby it's the black U.F.O.

Finally brave
I shoot 'em cos' I wouldn't be like a slave
Their needles deep inside my flesh and my bones still hurts
I don't want it, no more

Jump in the fight
And crash away the little green men tonight
They're catchin' you but you don't wanna fly away
This place's yours oh my lord","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2872

Lupin,Once More,"I don't wanna hurt you baby
But I have to go
Walking away's the only thing that
You'll understand on your own

Even if you cry it doesn't
Change my point of view
You know it's up to me to face it
But I have nothing to lose

Living inside a dream
Has been my right of way, run away
Dreaming of you has been my strength
To wipe those tears and hideaway

Don't be afraid, it's been the fate
You got my body, my love and hate
Stopping the tears, please do not cry
You know the time is passing by

If tomorrow I came back to you
And in a moment I think it's ok today
You leave, so baby love me once more

Baby please don't tell me
All the sadness of the crew
Honey you know I'm going to leave you
Love is just for the weak

Want to be my lover
Even if I be so far
Day after day I'm feeling lonely
And you know how much it's hard","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2249

Maggie May,Another Day,"I don't feel attraction
I was killed in action
Working all the day I'm not satisfied
Just need emotion
Give all my devotion
Loving all the night and don't feel me tired

I just need special feeling for live
And a boyfriend too
I've got all my desire to give
Don't be alone anymore anymore

Another day another lover
Another dream of broken hearts
Another life I will discover
I'm gonna fly ten miles apart

Another game another river
Another dream that makes me start
Another way I will discover
To fly away and don't come back, Don't come back

Looking for some action
Need no more distraction
Close my eyes and try to drive in the show
I will be a new emotion
Star in a new faction
Never sadness never more wear frown","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2356

Mako,Shellfire,"From sky control, to planet earth
Just one thousand miles above the world
The radar shows, intruders storm
Commencing the countdown, engines on

Take advantage on the star dust
Yor spaceships know which way to go
Use the white glow of the sunlight
Get your asses home!

Shellfire, shellfire, too dire
All of us to drop the bombs
Shellfire, shellfire, for players
Tracing bad guys from above

From planet earth, to sky control
The war field is clear now, 'cause we won
No one got lost, no heavy toll
Just call back the kids now, send them home","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=623

Burning like a fire
Looking for somebody just like you

Growing desperation
Nights without sensation
Since the day you left I'm not so cool

Shock!! breaking my life in two
Cut my body with a bite
Tear me up with dynamite
Shock!! you told me ""baby bye"" with a
smile
Such a bang in my mind

Sonic love supersonic love
Thunder in my brain pleasure mixed to
pain
Sonic love supersonic love
Fighting for survive keep my love alive
Sonic love supersonic love
Fire from a sin deep into my skin
Sonic love supersonic love
Crazy for your touch nothing is to
much

Looking for my lover
Maybe I discover
Just another woman wonderful

But my desperation
Gives me the sensation
That you where the girl most beautiful","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=1085

Marie Aldridge,After All,"Look at what you went and done
Yes you broke our relationship, you better fix it mister There's no place for you to run So you better just face it, better try and fix it mister

Already told you once,
You only ignored me after months, mister
This is the second time...
Enough is enough with you I'm losing my mind

Tell me after all love &amp; fantasy
You are into my soul
Tell me after all love &amp; harmony
You know
So after all

If you want to be the one
To keep our relationship, you better fix it mister
I am not just anyone

To take away tonight

Wanna dance with me?
Wanna spend the night to me?

Mark & Roby,Tokyo Tonight,"Boys and girls crowded life
All the city full of rumours inside
Crazy people everywhere up and down
But they never feel blue

Busy days funny nights
But nobody live for wasting his time
Time is money and the Japanese knows
How to make dreams come true

As a shock as a flight
Like an action movie, flash me tonight
I want you and you wanna me

Go go go Tokyo tonight
Hot and shiny city till the morning light
Lovely and sexy girls
Hot and crazy world just for you
Aih aih aih aih
Go go go Tokyo tonight
Rock and rollin' baby till the morning light
Funny funny girls
Hot and crazy world just for you

Boys and girls running fast
And it seems to be in a very big cast
Crazy people everywhere up and down
But they never feel blue

Busy days lovely nights
All the people live for feeling all right
That's the city where I wanna be free

Of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome
Would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday
I can go the distance
I will find my way
If I can be strong
I know ev'ry mile
Will be worth my while
When I go the distance
I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road
To embrace my fate
Though the road may wander
It will lead me to you
And a thousand years
Would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime
But somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back
I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track
No I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance
And my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star
I can go the distance
I will search the world
I will face its harms
I don't care how far
I can go the distance
TillI find my hero's welcome
Waiting in your arms...

I will search the world

Bring up the lights, let the music begin
Feeling the rhythm as the twirl and spin

Underneath the moon and the nightshade
There is no need to be afraid
This is how the game is played

We'll become anyone we choose
You and I so easily amuse
Everyone else seems to fade

Take my hand and lean in close
Feel the room spin, hear the echoes
Dancing close to the balcony
Soft is the breeze from the Corsican sea

When the stars assume their patterns
And the day has made his journey
To the life we knew
Before the world changed
When not a thing I held was true
But you were kind to me
And you reminded me

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost we could refuse to try
But you made it through
In the dark night
Who would those lucky guys turn out to be?
But that unusual blend
Of my funny friend and me

That the world is not my playground
There are other things that matter
What is simple needs protecting
My illusions all would shatter

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost we could refuse to try

But you stayed in my corner
When the only world I knew was upside down
And now the world and me
Know you carried me

I'm not as clever as I thought I was
I'm not the boy I used to be because
You showed me something different
You showed me something pure
I always seemed so certain
But I was really never sure
But you stayed
And you called my name
When others would have walked out on
A lousy game
And look who made it through
But your funny friend and you

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
That tiny planet and the bigger guy
I don't know wheter I should laugh or cry

Just like the patterns in the big sky
We'll be together 'til the end this time
Don't know the answer or the reason why
We'll stick together 'til the day we die

If I had to do this all a second time

Who would the angels send?

Packed a pair of pretty pecs

Going bonkers

Whose daring deeds are great the-a-ter?

Et je vois ma chatte qui sort

Elle s'en va se dandiant
Vers le monde sauvage et libre
Elle s'en va le printemps

C'est cupidon le roi assolu de l'amour
C'est cupidon qu'envol ses fleches tous les jours
C'est cupidon qui frappe les bons, les mauvais
C'est pas possible que l'on puisse se sauver
Je l'attends pour vivre mes reves, mes desirs, l'amour

Et comme une enfant
Aux histories je auis croyate
C'est vrai, oui, c'est vrai

Un jour qu'il pleuvait

Morris,Bad Tonight,"Generate adrenaline
Estimate ability
To run after you
Be tainted by you
And throw myself away

'Cause I'm feeling that passion everyday
'cause my memory runs at yesterday
And now's the time
To make you mine again
You'll play a dangerous game

Because I'm bad tonight
You riding on my rockey
I feel O.K.
No matter what you say
Because I'm bad tonight
I'll push you through the limits
I don't wanna know if it's wrong or it's right

Hanging from your fingertips
I know what it takes
Being caught in your wake
That blows myself away","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=252

Dead like the flower that burns in the heat of summer,
Life's sweet aroma is filling the air

Nana Takahashi,Cherry-Blossom Pleasure Ghost,"Thousand of years.
It has been waiting for the bloom.
All doom and gloom.

Hopes and fears.
Just an unsatisfied hunger.
I can't stand it any longer.

Break the spell. This boring Hell.
I'm bloody longing for the time of resurrection.
Set me free. I'm on the spree.
Close the books on deadly life in the jade erection.

Stuck on you! You call my name, Make my lips moist and hot.
But not you! You confuse me, Are you gonna pay the painful price?
Lust for you! You commit yourself to playing my honey pot.
It's up to you! You copy?
My name is Cherry-Blossom Pleasure Ghost.

Seeking for prey.
I got your milky hot spring.
Baby You're on a string.

Sleek foreplay.
Gimme a pearl necklace to me.
You're sacrifice-to-be.

Rumbling sound. Deep in the ground.
My Cherry, let me hear your budding beat.
Butterflies rise on the sly.
Now I'm feeling so much hornier than a bitch on heat.

Look at you! You conquer me? but You're gonna take your toll.
Oh poor you! You call out for help. You're victim of my naughty boobs.
I pity you! You command me? Know your place. You're on deathroll.
Because of You! You're cocky!

Working for her man, she brings hom her pay

Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear

Tommy got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used
To make it talk - so tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers: Baby it's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference

What a strong emotion!
Praying for the wind to blow the gasoline
Wanna breath the action!

Night all around me I can hear the engine
Pilot is the hero

Ready for the thrill

And I feel alive oh yeah!

Guess you'll believe in my tonight
I wanna show you all my crazy world
Oh be my lover!

Remember all the time
We used to play with love
I was joking with my blue destiny
I didn't realize you're so precious, honey...

I wanna show my love for you
Keeping my heart alive... it's gonna last forever
Deeper and strong is my love for you
Can you be mine tonight... I wanna kiss you ever

Time, baby, has come and you will see

Gonna leave you on your own
Believe in me

There is a time in every life...
You realize you have to change
The wayou took
Even the aim you had

(I) wanna help your soul
To forgive my sin of love
Over and over again
I wanna tell you

Never forget my love
Every recall
For I guess you're losing even my heart
Baby never forget my love
Never again
'Cause I know you're lonely even tonight

Have you begun to built your life
Wanna teach you how to fly
Without my love
Could you be alive again","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=619

Norma Sheffield,Nothing Changed,"You and I, thinking of all the times we spent together. Everyday seemed to me, I like a walking dream, a picture of perfection But gradually, as time goes by, seems your love lost its lustre. With your eyes full of doubt, your suspicions aroused, your voices so full of tension. Recently you're been pouting, accusing me of unkindness. Tell me, how could you believe I would ever hurt you so please listen to what I say

I will protect you, don't you forget it, your love means the world to me girl. You are my angel, nothing will change that, your love is what keeps me strong girl. Love is forever, time is a healer, let's welcome the joy to come, girl. Deeper &amp; deeper, sweeter &amp; sweeter, together we'll build a future that lasts.

Losing sight of the precious things that made us special. Pretty quarrels all day, see our temper are frayed, rejection &amp; depression. Clever words and conversation won't save us from this heartache. There's a far better way of expressing ourselves, I'll hold you oh so tightly. We're both been playing games, let's give this fighting a rest now. Turn our backs on the past, we'll forget all the pain, the good times are here to stay.","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=3277

Odyssey,Calm and the Storm,"Echo in the deep, I'm waiting quietly
Let my worrying fade
Did you say my name, I'm quickly withering
Far too timid to stay

Right in front of me, a brand new confidence,
Moments powerless gone
My apologies, my old fragility
I am moving beyond

No, I won't take another step away
I have tasted blood tonight
Oh, this power is nothing I have known
Something in it feels so right!

Calm and the storm, I am feeling reborn
Who dares to face me tonight?
Calm and the storm, face the daunting unknown
Bringing a new rage to light

Calm and the storm, now my facade is torn
Glowing red across the blue
Calm and the storm, I am building in scorn
A fatal decision for you

Get yourself away, I won't be going back
Goodness rendered me weak
Walling up my heart will keep from breaking it
Solace for the once meek","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4324

by my own hand, I'm daring the unknown!

Eye to eye with a looming disaster
I'm done crying and hating who I am
Brand new life with a confidence mastered
I know that I can

Count me out of a looming depression
I'm done lying and tearing me apart
You had me doubled up in the corner
Now it's over, 'cause I know who I am!

I can feel my power coming back to me
Grateful to be alive","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4343

Odyssey,Final Breath,"Nothing of this earth will sate my hunger,
Nothing will satisfy.
Even if I found another lover,
If she catches my eye.

Like the wind we'll never last forever,
Fading under the moon.
Only one thing will keep us together,
And it died out with you!

If I told you I loved you, would you still have survived?
Every day gone without you is tearing like a knife.
As a mortal, I dance on the precipice of death.
Till the day we're united, I draw my final breath!

Infinite romance is more than just a dream,
it's our circumstance.
How I rue the day I did not find out,
I did not take the chance!","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4313

Voice that the world should hear above all any others

Quiet and not believe but I can't dodge a vision
I had so many years back, it told me I was
Destined to share with you the joys of love and freedom

Someday, over the horizon, I'll be there with you
A hidden paradise
Join me, I can make it easy
Rid yourself of petty vice...

(With a), Loud, Burning Faith, I echo to you
I can't wait to see you running to me
Arms open wide I'm welcoming you
Is your soul crying out, ""Salvation""?

Loud, Burning Faith, you echo to me
I believe it, though I cannot see it
Love welling up inside your body
Now let it burn you alive!

I may be small and frail here in person
But the spirits are stronger than the many foes I face here
Leading the way is nothing if I can join the
Millions of the saved... why can't I take you with me?","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4323

What kind of killer do I gotta overthrow
Just to get a little peace and quiet?
I know I need to get away somewhere,
But somehow the world will deny it

Why does it feel like I can never break this ceiling,
and take a moment just to cry?
Sometimes I get tired of this vengeance in my eyes!

I don't want to waste another day away from lovin' you
Got these feelins taking over like rabbits on the moon
Let's indulge a life of lunacy I feel is overdue
Dream away and we can make it to the rabbits on the moon

Worshippers gather in fear
Lock yourselves in for the night

Miles and miles away

Torn between Hell and Makai
There, but for vengeance, go I

Hellfire nipping at Achilles' heels, I kill

Nothin' gonna stop me till I take you down, you see
You'll see me but you'll never hear a sound

You tear my home apart, then I'll get you and yours

My survival's not a problem you were thinking of
You're dying to me, although you had the chance
For another life of playing in the game ""romance""
You're like a Zombie, bitten out of my soul
You've forgotten all the times I made you lose control

Bleeding out from your knife

To discern what your cruelty is all about

Neither Goddess or machine prevents my attacking...!

Hatred seeping out of every pore, for you
Your fire has made my life a burning hell!
Though I have no single drop of royal blood
I know I've been defiled!

While you torture me for your ecstasy
You don't know what I have to store for you!
All this bloodlust must bring you to entropy...

You can't trust me so high

Burn in my heart
Can I tell you so fine
I can't wait, my guy

SO MUCH IN LOVE I'm fallin'
With you, can I smell your neck again
SO MUCH IN LOVE I'm living
With you, can I take your love forever

Someone says I love you to have
Easy lovers, I know
Without feeling or love

All my time is your time
With no lies to release","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2218

Queen Of Times,Waste My Time,"Only two weeks ago

And every boy I see
Reminds me what I felt for you

The reason you left me
It's hurtin' me one more time
I don't believe you
I'll never trust you
I know you betray sometimes

All my time I've spent with you together
Is telling me not to fall in your smile trap
Never trust the man who lies forever
I'm not gonna waste my time for loving you

I'm gonna live again
Without your love I'm feeling safe
You'll never be my friend
The loss of you is not disgrace","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=1501

Every night I'm here so lonely
And I don't know how to carry on
I can feel the life flowing in my veins
Is it a dream or is reality

But the way that I feel when I look at me
Baby is a storm that burst inside
And I pray you to take this pain apart
So that I never have to worry

I don't want to spend my life forever
Trying hard to find my lover I don't care if you are nobody Baby I love you so take me a way Be my tears in times of crying Hold me when the sun won't shine Baby don't forget about me Don't leave me screaming with nothing to say

Can seem so long - when I look at I
why it's not far
Can't be very far but not too close

I never say the things I want you (to) understand
I can't take no more of all the rumours at hand
Because boy we got the red moon shining in our heart

I was hoping somehow
That some body could step in and change the wind
But I decided no - no there can be no way
So I stand like a rock
And I'm feeling so strong and I'll never cry
Open the window - shoot at the town bang! bang! bang!

Won't you hold my heart Mr. Valentine
No no no your love don't make me small

No no no you know that I can't dance

What to do what to do
No matter how I try no way that I
Can't stay a little dreamy girl

I'm look at the clock and there I see the stars
It's already midnight the fever is on and I'm down
The love we have will never find it's home
We sit out the hours 'til the morning comes
The first thing tomorrow love is on the run
And I know it's not the thing I want to fill my heart

I was hoping somehow
That some body could step in and change the wind
But I decided no - no there can be no way
So I stand like a rock

So come alive and show me your love, I need you

I wanna feel the wheels on fire
Up and down, won’t you rock and do?

Shocking like a boom
Magic like the moon

Get into my car
And so you can drive me crazy

Live the city nights
Together with me now…

I'm fooling, wasting time
Aristocratic cousin, lady and king
I gave my love of very special queen
But why would you say
You don't know what you need
That's why, baby

So wrong, too long, this took
No matter, who you are
Now that I've discovered
Thousand reasons to believe in

You'll never trust my words and
my love
So your love
It must have been an excuse
Can't you understand me?
A life together a never ending love

I'm gonna stop : It's a burning heart
If you keep on, you will be breaking,
Losing my burning heart
Don't go, be close to me
Stay together all night long

Baby don't go 'cause I need you
You'll never understand, it's
true-blue
It looks to me like a desert land
I can't say I'll promise the moon","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=2010

But our love today is more
Than being together
I got a loving for you!

And I search somebody on my way
A kind of dreams, (a) kind of play
Where I miss your body
Waiting there and talking to you
And in the dream I'm gettin'
More than a fool

All around like a fool with my love
And with a ""red red fire""
Deep down inside of my heart.

Everynight face to face in the smoke
I had the ""Black Jack fever""
Not for money and for the chicks
In the dark I was there just to say
It has beeen a good good pleasure
Who want to play with me now?

Everybody was looking for the big star
And I was what they wanted
When everybody was waiting for the black card
(I) Was lucky for me.

BLACK JACK FEVER
Not for money and not for many diamonds
Bad bad fever
Not for money and not for many girlfriends

Just for my name in the past and the green of the table.

In these days I re-think (of) the good times

Memories of you when you were touching all me
Memories of you always with me.

Am I all to blame for your surprise departure
Don't you miss me now love, keep on feeling lonely

Tear! Heaven or Hell?
Trauma! Until your last dying breath.

With the mission to break the endless chain of tragic fate.
Born to be a cold-blooded Warrior Princess of the Reich.
Remember!
Cannot escape from the frightening nemesis of their hate.
In the name of Warrior princess of the Reich...

Lunatic! Running away from fear.
Fanatic! The end is coming near.
Prophecy! You'll see? No mercy!
Long live! Princess of the Reich.

Faceless slavery.
Always just waiting for salvation and dawn.
Long fatal march to the Armageddon lives on and on...

Pain! Went to hell and back.
Insane! Some people say ""They have no luck.""
Tear! Saints or sinners?
You're under the sentence of death!

On a mission. She's coming from the valley of shaman.
All the wicked man fear the Warrior Princess of teh Reich.
Remember.
Cannot escape savage punishment for the beast of man.
In the name of Warrior Princess Of The Reich...

Better find the right way (better you run)

Going through your head
No one can make it out
It's building up
And carrying you away

Break 'em loose and dance around the fire
The fire
Break 'em loose and dance around the lies
Keep 'em  strong as you move
Break 'em loose and dance around the fire
Every night always higher
Break 'em loose and dance until you brake away

Backed into a corner (what you can do)
Ready and excited (and dance around the fire)
Everybody's stalking me (wherever you are)
Better if I run away (better you run)

SylverR,Night Trip,"I wanna take you high
High up in the sky
Until you loose control
I wanna make you dance
Make your soul release
This room's for two of us

We gonna take a ride
To the shining star
With magic of the sounds
I wanna make you mine
Every step and turn
Let's get down to the free world

When I finish a day
I'm like an empty closet
Nothin' to choose
Going straight back home
Turn on the radio
Laying down on the bed

But sometimes I miss the beat
Deep down inside my heart
Telling me to get up
Then call up my friends
Here we go again tonight
'Get together'

I wanna take you high
High up in the sky
Until you loose control
I wanna make you dance
Make your soul release
This room's for two of us

Met a girl of my dream
She's got an angel smile
Looking my eyes
Coming through the door
She took my breath away
Knocking me down

Should I go and say hello?
Maybe it's the only chance
Asking her out to be
Staying by my side
She will be the queen of the night
Forevermore","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=1608

Tired of mere fantasy
You are the star I survive by in the night, so

Please don't go away

Why I can't let you go

So, never hide it, oh, never fight it, render all your burdens on me

China Gal, I can't live without your love
I'll guide your heart with my soul
I can't shake this per-rem-o-ni-ti-on that

I will give it back and many more, and many more

Faithful Heart, your love is my joy
Don't you ever take that away
If I never wake up to see you tomorrow
At least I know that I loved you for today
It's your faithful heart keeps me coming back

Just confirming what a man-eater you are
One more victim of midnights bizarre
I just can't get away

Why can't I just love you, my darling
It's not all black and blue
I instead see black white and red
as the last live thought into my head!

Our love is too young to die
Why send me off with a lie?
If we'd try again you'd say no
Why dance around it, girl... and just tell me it is so!!!

Now I await the pain of the first massive bite
I was foolish so I won't put up a fight
I concede I'm a fool of the night
Wait for death to come down
Something is wrong, you're crying deep into my arms
Far beyond you now to do me any harm
Hush now darling, no need for alarm

like golden raindrops from our eyes
The more I even try just to hide them

I can't tell where you are
I cannot escape
Have you now claimed my fate?

Leave me in the night
Plainly, in your sight, I am
nothing but a fool and I know
you were right again!
Leave me in the dark,
I hope you go far, never
see me again

Turning in the cold
Marching into the snow
You have taken me out and you are
making me whole again
Save me from the dark
Knowing what you are, I will
see you again

Petals dance
Across a blue and crystal sky
To return to what burned me before
I've reason to die

And you've fallen away
But I want you to stay
Trust me once again
This cannot be the end!

Since I could ever forget your touch

Shaking in the mirror
with a shiver in my spine
Am I dying or alive
Would I face infinity for you, for you?

Somewhere in the middle of a merry melody

Vanish in the moment of the blinking of an eye

My suspicious intuition tells me something ain't right
I can feel a certain heaviness rolling out into the sky
Too much my life is put on ""delay""
I would rather give you something like a silly display
How many chances for this 'till the moment you die?

Our darkest moments are a gift from above
How else are we to determine a moment of love
We can't let something like a little rain
get in the way!

We're in a Rain Dance, let it splash on your head
You could'a been in pain but you're rejoicing instead
It's a Rain Dance, finding joy through your pain
And once you've done it this time you are never the same
Rain Dance, but we're bright as the sun
And you're the ones I'm thanking when the moment is done
and this Rain Dance helping you feel alive
and waiting for another dance, another time!

Now that I'm back and the sun is in view
I can contemplate no better way to spend time with you
But even I know that these pleasantries are not to last
So I have faith that I'll see you again
though I cannot answer questions like where how or when
Why bother planning when life goes by you so fast?

You've got a faith like a mountain and you won't let it die!)","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4265

There you were in a blaze of glory
Giving reason to my life

As a second grows infinite
Long before the minute
You have rescued me
And I promise to return it
Every day to earn it
Rescued finally
Cause of you, I survive,
Savior of the sky!

Years in the future I still linger at your side
I wouldn't dream to have more
Tonight I'm eagerly waiting your decision to keep me
Or to leave me as before","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=4266

Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
and kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat

And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
you can treat him bad and leave him

My my, I could never let you go.

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong.

Got to get it now (and...)
Bye bye girl - bye bye girl
We stay forever on the dance floor
Bye bye girl - bye bye girl

Oh baby, touch me here, kiss me there
Tell me you wanna stay and
Take a smile, make me cry
You take me higher
""Toccami, baciami""
That's all I want
Are you true or a liar?

Go away, stay with me
Tie me up, I won't escape: you will set me free!
Don't go, don't stay
Got to move it

Walking on the dyno
Walking on the dyno
Walking on the dynosaur of love
Together we are rolling like a rolling stone
Wee at the dyno meat well cooked to the bone
Walking on the dyno
Walking on the dyno
Walk the dynosaur of love

Bang a gong monkey-kong
Cump your sweet banana
Somebody's stoning the dusty floor again
Comes a bark from the dark
Of the wild savannah
Tonite we're gonna lock up the door again

Wilson Ferguson,I'm Singing Again,"How many times I'll go so lonely
Many nights without your love
Tears are falling down so wetting all the floor

Many colors on the rainbow
And shadows in my life
When I'm looking for your eyes I feel to die

Many troubles in my story
And shadows in my life
When I'm calling for your name, I feel to die

I'm singing again for love
I'm singing for you
Little devil when I'm singing in the rain

I'm singing again for tomorrow
I'm crying for you
When I'm touching all the colors of the pain","https://www.eurobeat-prime.com/lyrics.php?lyrics=1668

In my life I wanna travel the world around... yes

The kind of place to get into your heart
And blow your mind
The sun is warm the people is so lovely
The moon is a friend and wants to sing with you

Take me, take me in the heart of Rome
Romance and domes
The night won't be long enough
Take me, take me in the heart of Rome
And nothing will be too much

Where the days are easy and where the nights are sweet... yes

Will drive us all round in a golden cab
